This web-page uses the logic of Klipper's [graphstats.py](https://github.com/Klipper3d/klipper/blob/master/scripts/graphstats.py) to analyze a `klippy.log` and display the results in graphs. This is a direct transformation of the Python script and thus based on the original work of Kevin O'Connor.

Feedback or improvements are always welcome.
